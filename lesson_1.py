# This is lesson 1 assignment

# # A:
# first = 7
# second = 44.3
# print(first + second)
# print(first * second)
# print(second / first)

# B:
# a = 9
# b = 8
# c = 15

# C:
# name = “john”     
# name= 'john'
# As long as you use "" or '', what is printed will be similar. 


# 2. What is the issue with the code below? 
 
# my_number = str(5+5) 
# print("result is: "+my_number)

# D. 
# What will be the output?  
 
# x = 5  
# y = 2.36  
# print (x+int (y) )

# This prints 7

# E. 
# 1. Create two variables named X and Y. 
# 2. Print “BIG” if X is bigger than Y. 
# 3. Print “small” if X is smaller than Y. 

# x = input("Please provide a first number. Let's call it X: ")
# y = input("Please provide a second number. Let's call it Y: ")

# if x > y:
#     print("BIG")
# else:
#     print("small")


# F. 
# 1. Create a variable and initialize it with a number 1-4. 
# 2. Create 4 conditions (if-elif) which will check the variable. 
# 3. Print the season name accordingly: 
 
# - 1 = summer 
# - 2 = winter 
# - 3 = fall 
# - 4 = spring 
 
# lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# season = int(input("Please provide a number between 1-4: "))
# if season == lst[0]:
#     print("Summer")
# elif season == lst[1]:
#     print("Winter")
# elif season == lst[2]:
#     print("Fall")
# elif season == lst[3]:
#     print("Spring")
# else:
#     print("Please provide a valid number")



# CHALLENGE: 
# Fix the following code without changing a or b:  
 
# a = 8  
# b = "123" 
# b = int("123") 
 
# print(a+b)
