# A:
# first = 7
# second = 44.3
# print(first + second)
# print(first * second)
# print(second / first)

# B:
# a = 9
# b = 8
# c = 15

# C:
# name = “john”     
# name= 'john'
# As long as you use "" or '', what is printed will be similar. 


# 2. What is the issue with the code below? 
 
# my_number = str(5+5) 
# print("result is: "+my_number)
